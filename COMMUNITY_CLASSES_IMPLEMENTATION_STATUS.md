## 📋 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Deployment:
1. ✅ Run `npx prisma generate` to update Prisma client
2. ✅ Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_community_classes_module` (or `prisma db push` for dev)
3. ✅ Run `npx tsx scripts/seed-permissions.ts` to seed new permissions
4. ⚠️ Test locally:
   - Create community client
   - Create community class
   - Create community invoice
   - Approve invoice (should queue for email)
   - View email queue
   - Send batch email

### Server Deployment:
1. Pull latest code
2. Run `npm install` (if new dependencies)
3. Run `npx prisma generate`
4. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` (production-safe migration)
5. Run `npx tsx scripts/seed-permissions.ts`
6. Run `npm run build`
7. Restart PM2: `pm2 restart aplus-center`

### Environment Variables:
- ✅ Reuse existing SMTP vars:
  - `SMTP_HOST`
  - `SMTP_PORT`
  - `SMTP_SECURE`
  - `SMTP_USER`
  - `SMTP_PASS`
  - `EMAIL_FROM`
  - `EMAIL_APPROVAL_RECIPIENTS`
- Optional: Add `COMMUNITY_INVOICE_RECIPIENTS` (falls back to `EMAIL_APPROVAL_RECIPIENTS` if not set)

## 🎯 ACCEPTANCE TESTS

1. ✅ Main dashboard shows "Community Classes" tile (only for permitted roles)
2. ✅ Community dashboard loads with 3 tiles
3. ⚠️ Community Clients page works (clone existing, separate data)
4. ⚠️ Create class "Yoga" rate $25.00 → shows in table
5. ⚠️ Create invoice for client X, class Yoga, 2 units → Total $50.00, Status DRAFT
6. ⚠️ Approve invoice → Status QUEUED, appears in email queue
7. ⚠️ Email queue loads without errors
8. ⚠️ Send batch → sends ONE email with all queued invoices, marks SENT
9. ⚠️ Print invoice → shows correct format with Smart Steps ABA header
10. ⚠️ No regressions to existing BCBA timesheets/email queue

## 📝 NOTES

- All community data is completely separate from main ABA data
- Email queue reuses existing `EmailQueueItem` table with `COMMUNITY_INVOICE` entity type
- Permissions follow same pattern as timesheets module
- UI styling matches existing pages exactly
- Print/PDF uses same "Smart Steps ABA" header as timesheets
