## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with database credentials
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run create-admin
npm run dev
```

### Server Deployment
See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

## 📝 Notes

- The application structure is ready
- Database schema is complete
- Authentication is working
- Basic pages are functional
- Full feature implementation is needed for production use

The foundation is solid - you can start building out the remaining features incrementally.
