## 🚀 What Was Deployed

### 1. **Complete Timesheet Rebuild**
   - ✅ Custom `TimeFieldAMPM` component - accepts ANY valid time (1:00, 2:15, 3:25, etc.)
   - ✅ Dedicated AM/PM toggle next to every time input
   - ✅ No auto-jumping, no forced conversions, no snapping
   - ✅ Colon auto-insertion after numeric entry
   - ✅ Time stored as structured fields: `{ hour, minute, meridiem }`

### 2. **Default Times → Day Row Sync**
   - ✅ Default DR times automatically apply to DR day rows
   - ✅ Default SV times automatically apply to SV day rows
   - ✅ Manual edits override defaults (tracked via `touched` flags)
   - ✅ Updates occur immediately and reliably

### 3. **Checkbox Fixes**
   - ✅ Added "Use" checkbox for DR (matches SV behavior)
   - ✅ Both DR and SV checkboxes behave identically

### 4. **Removed Features**
   - ✅ Rounding logic removed entirely
   - ✅ Units column removed from bottom section
   - ✅ Overnight rows removed (DR and SV)
   - ✅ Day labels removed from bottom table
   - ✅ Timesheet ID removed from print/export output

### 5. **Overlap Prevention (Frontend + Backend)**
   - ✅ Frontend: Highlights conflicting rows and time fields in red
   - ✅ Frontend: Displays human-readable conflict messages
   - ✅ Frontend: Disables Save button when conflicts exist
   - ✅ Frontend: Scrolls to first conflict automatically
   - ✅ Backend: Server-side validation in POST and PUT routes
   - ✅ Backend: Returns structured error data with conflict details
   - ✅ Rules: Prevents overlaps for same Provider/Client/Timesheet, DR vs DR, SV vs SV, DR vs SV

### 6. **Export & Print**
   - ✅ Print functionality (via `TimesheetPrintPreview`)
   - ✅ Export to Excel (.xlsx)
   - ✅ Export to CSV
   - ✅ Timesheet ID removed from all exports
   - ✅ Overnight column removed from exports
   - ✅ Readable AM/PM formatting in exports

### 7. **Automated Invoicing**
   - ✅ Runs every Tuesday at 7:00 AM (server time)
   - ✅ Generates invoices based on approved timesheets
   - ✅ Uses insurance rate per unit (1 unit = 15 minutes)
   - ✅ No rounding applied to units

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Tests
- [x] Manual time entry (all valid times)
- [x] AM/PM toggling without changing hour/minute
- [x] Default → day sync (DR and SV separately)
- [x] Overlap detection with UI highlighting
- [x] Overlap against existing saved timesheets
- [x] Edge cases (end == start)
- [x] Save blocking when conflicts exist
- [x] Export correctness (CSV, Excel)
- [x] Print correctness
- [x] Timesheet ID removed from exports
- [x] Overnight column removed from exports
- [x] Automated invoicing scheduled correctly

### 🔍 User Acceptance Testing Required
- [ ] Test time entry with various formats (1:00, 2:15, 3:25, etc.)
- [ ] Test AM/PM toggling
- [ ] Test default times → day row sync
- [ ] Test overlap detection (create overlapping entries)
- [ ] Test save blocking when overlaps exist
- [ ] Test export to CSV and Excel
- [ ] Test print functionality
- [ ] Verify Timesheet ID is NOT in exports/prints
- [ ] Verify automated invoice generation on next Tuesday
